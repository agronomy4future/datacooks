Description: Provides a utility function for extracting regression diagnostics from linear
    models, including predicted values, residuals, leverage, studentized residuals, and
    Cook's distance. The function attaches these diagnostics to the original dataset
    used in model fitting and automatically flags influential outliers. Includes an
    option to return a cleaned dataset with outliers removed.
